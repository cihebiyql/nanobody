## Top classified poses

| model | class | rank | hotspot | total_occlusion | cdr3_occlusion | cdr3_fraction | reason |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| cluster_1_model_1 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 1 | 16 | 702 | 124 | 0.176638 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_2 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 2 | 20 | 662 | 133 | 0.200906 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_3 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 3 | 15 | 601 | 130 | 0.216306 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_4 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 4 | 17 | 750 | 123 | 0.164 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_2_model_1 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 5 | 18 | 650 | 101 | 0.155385 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_3_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 6 | 12 | 658 | 128 | 0.194529 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |
| cluster_4_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 7 | 17 | 684 | 98 | 0.143275 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |

## Interpretation boundary

- `BLOCKER_LIKE_A` means structurally blocker-like under the HR-151-calibrated screen, not experimentally proven blocking.
- `BINDER_LIKE_C` catches the known failure mode where hotspot/interface contact does not create PVRL2 occlusion.
- Format/Fc/NK/TIGIT/CD226 effects must be evaluated as separate biology or architecture layers.
- Repeat the overlay against 9E6Y before final candidate ranking.
