## Interpretation boundary

- `BLOCKER_LIKE_A` means structurally blocker-like under the HR-151-calibrated screen, not experimentally proven blocking.
- `BINDER_LIKE_C` catches the known failure mode where hotspot/interface contact does not create PVRL2 occlusion.
- Format/Fc/NK/TIGIT/CD226 effects must be evaluated as separate biology or architecture layers.
- Repeat the overlay against 9E6Y before final candidate ranking.
