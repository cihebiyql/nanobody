| cluster_1_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 1 | 13 | 729 | 121 | 0.165981 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |

## Interpretation boundary

- `BLOCKER_LIKE_A` means structurally blocker-like under the HR-151-calibrated screen, not experimentally proven blocking.
- `BINDER_LIKE_C` catches the known failure mode where hotspot/interface contact does not create PVRL2 occlusion.
- Format/Fc/NK/TIGIT/CD226 effects must be evaluated as separate biology or architecture layers.
- Repeat the overlay against 9E6Y before final candidate ranking.
