## Top classified poses

| model | class | rank | hotspot | total_occlusion | cdr3_occlusion | cdr3_fraction | reason |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| cluster_3_model_1 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 4 | 19 | 645 | 112 | 0.173643 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_4 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 6 | 15 | 780 | 125 | 0.160256 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 1 | 17 | 764 | 111 | 0.145288 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |
| cluster_2_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 2 | 17 | 607 | 83 | 0.136738 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |
| cluster_1_model_2 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 3 | 12 | 714 | 127 | 0.177871 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |
| cluster_1_model_3 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 5 | 15 | 792 | 114 | 0.143939 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |
| cluster_4_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 7 | 11 | 798 | 130 | 0.162907 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |

## Interpretation boundary

- `BLOCKER_LIKE_A` means structurally blocker-like under the HR-151-calibrated screen, not experimentally proven blocking.
- `BINDER_LIKE_C` catches the known failure mode where hotspot/interface contact does not create PVRL2 occlusion.
- Format/Fc/NK/TIGIT/CD226 effects must be evaluated as separate biology or architecture layers.
- Repeat the overlay against 9E6Y before final candidate ranking.
