## Top classified poses

| model | class | rank | hotspot | total_occlusion | cdr3_occlusion | cdr3_fraction | reason |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| cluster_1_model_1 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 1 | 17 | 751 | 133 | 0.177097 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_2 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 2 | 19 | 783 | 133 | 0.16986 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_3 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 3 | 16 | 798 | 134 | 0.16792 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_4 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 4 | 18 | 717 | 138 | 0.192469 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_2_model_1 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 5 | 17 | 722 | 123 | 0.17036 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_3_model_1 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 6 | 16 | 684 | 120 | 0.175439 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_4_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 7 | 12 | 573 | 85 | 0.148342 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |

## Interpretation boundary

- `BLOCKER_LIKE_A` means structurally blocker-like under the HR-151-calibrated screen, not experimentally proven blocking.
- `BINDER_LIKE_C` catches the known failure mode where hotspot/interface contact does not create PVRL2 occlusion.
- Format/Fc/NK/TIGIT/CD226 effects must be evaluated as separate biology or architecture layers.
- Repeat the overlay against 9E6Y before final candidate ranking.
