## Summary

- BLOCKER_LIKE_A: 3
- BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B: 1

## Top classified poses

| model | class | rank | hotspot | total_occlusion | cdr3_occlusion | cdr3_fraction | reason |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| cluster_1_model_1 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 1 | 14 | 724 | 128 | 0.176796 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_2 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 2 | 14 | 711 | 124 | 0.174402 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_3 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 3 | 14 | 748 | 124 | 0.165775 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_4 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 4 | 13 | 732 | 130 | 0.177596 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |

## Interpretation boundary

- `BLOCKER_LIKE_A` means structurally blocker-like under the HR-151-calibrated screen, not experimentally proven blocking.
- `BINDER_LIKE_C` catches the known failure mode where hotspot/interface contact does not create PVRL2 occlusion.
- Format/Fc/NK/TIGIT/CD226 effects must be evaluated as separate biology or architecture layers.
- Repeat the overlay against 9E6Y before final candidate ranking.
