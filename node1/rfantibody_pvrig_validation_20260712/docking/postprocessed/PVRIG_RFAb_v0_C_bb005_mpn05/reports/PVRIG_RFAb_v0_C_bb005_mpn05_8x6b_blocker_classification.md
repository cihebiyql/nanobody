## Top classified poses

| model | class | rank | hotspot | total_occlusion | cdr3_occlusion | cdr3_fraction | reason |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| cluster_1_model_1 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 1 | 15 | 668 | 108 | 0.161677 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_2 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 3 | 15 | 763 | 139 | 0.182176 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_3 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 4 | 15 | 791 | 143 | 0.180784 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_1_model_4 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 6 | 16 | 768 | 136 | 0.177083 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_2_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 2 | 13 | 688 | 147 | 0.213663 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |
| cluster_2_model_2 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 5 | 10 | 710 | 138 | 0.194366 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |
| cluster_3_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 7 | 9 | 632 | 124 | 0.196203 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |

## Interpretation boundary

- `BLOCKER_LIKE_A` means structurally blocker-like under the HR-151-calibrated screen, not experimentally proven blocking.
- `BINDER_LIKE_C` catches the known failure mode where hotspot/interface contact does not create PVRL2 occlusion.
- Format/Fc/NK/TIGIT/CD226 effects must be evaluated as separate biology or architecture layers.
- Repeat the overlay against 9E6Y before final candidate ranking.
