## Top classified poses

| model | class | rank | hotspot | total_occlusion | cdr3_occlusion | cdr3_fraction | reason |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| cluster_1_model_1 | BLOCKER_LIKE_A | 1 | 14 | 755 | 212 | 0.280795 | passes HR-151-calibrated hotspot, total occlusion, CDR3 occlusion, and CDR3 fraction thresholds |
| cluster_2_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 2 | 13 | 626 | 128 | 0.204473 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |
| cluster_3_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 3 | 10 | 686 | 162 | 0.236152 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |
| cluster_8_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 8 | 9 | 807 | 212 | 0.262701 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |
| cluster_10_model_1 | BLOCKER_PLAUSIBLE_B | 10 | 10 | 806 | 214 | 0.265509 | substantial PVRL2 occlusion exists but one or more HR-151-calibrated A thresholds are missing |

## Interpretation boundary

- `BLOCKER_LIKE_A` means structurally blocker-like under the HR-151-calibrated screen, not experimentally proven blocking.
- `BINDER_LIKE_C` catches the known failure mode where hotspot/interface contact does not create PVRL2 occlusion.
- Format/Fc/NK/TIGIT/CD226 effects must be evaluated as separate biology or architecture layers.
- Repeat the overlay against 9E6Y before final candidate ranking.
